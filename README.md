# System Extras

A complimentary set of extensions to Swift System.

Our goals are:
1. Feel natural to use in conjunction to existing System APIs
2. Provide missing batteries from System
3. (Unlike System) prefer ergonomics over loyalty to native APIs
2. (Unlike System) strive for cross-platform APIs (as opposed to [multi-platform][])

[multi-platform]: https://github.com/apple/swift-system#multi-platform-not-cross-platform

This library lets you create/read/update/delete files, directories, symlinks, and permissions, all the while leveraging the familiar types from Swift Systems.
And yes, it all works on Windows!
